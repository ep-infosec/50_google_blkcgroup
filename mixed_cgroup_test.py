# A fairly minimal test to run a test experiment with two workers:
#   - A random read worker, with 60% dtf
#   - A sequential writer (direct writes), with 40% dtf
#
# This test also serves to show off how methods can be hooked in before and
# after an experiment to retrieve container statistics for debugging.
